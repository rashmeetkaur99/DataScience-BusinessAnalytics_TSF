The task says to predict the percentage scores for given number of study hours. Therefore, in order to predict one variable (scores) on the basis of another variable (hours) we will have to run **Simple Linear Regression**. The word simple here signifies that there is one dependent variable (scores) and one independent variable (hours).
I have used R-Programming to run regression. Before starting the with regression part, I have installed the libraries required to run regression. 
Note- This is not just regression but prediction using Machine learning. This difference is, without applying Machine Learning technique the code will give the result of the speicifc problem but on the other hand, applying Machine Learning will allow us to change some inputs on the same program to obtain different outputs.
